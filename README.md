# Portfolio

## Description
- This is my take on a portfolio. I added a little spice to make it more me.
- This is my first attempt at making a portfolio and I am sure it will get better as I learn more about coding and get more comfortable with my new skills. 
- It has been so fun learning to code and making something out of nothing. 
- I can not wait to continue to advance my skills and make more wonderful websites.
